   <section class="MianpageIntroduction">
    <blockquote>"Petal & Poem is not a shop; it is a story waiting to unfold.<br>
      Each bouquet, a stanza; each bloom, a line of poetry,<br>
      woven with the delicate threads of nature's finest silk.<br>
      Here, roses do not simply bloom—they sigh with the weight of unsent letters.<br>
      Lilies do not merely stand—they hum soft elegies for fleeting moments.<br>
      Peonies unfurl like sonnets, their fragrance lingering like a lover's touch.<br>
      For those who long to confess, we bind petals into love letters.<br>
      For those who yearn to remember, we weave flowers into memories.<br>
      For those who seek beauty in the ephemeral, we craft eternity in a single bloom.<br>
      Step into our sanctuary, where every arrangement is a verse,<br>
      every fragrance a melody, every petal a promise.<br>
      Let us write your story in flowers,<br>
      for some emotions are too tender for words—
      and so, they blossom.<br>
      Petal & Poem — where flowers speak the language of poetry."</blockquote>

    <h2>A Garden of Verses</h2>
    <p>From timeless roses to rare wildflowers,<br> our selection is as diverse<br> as the emotions they convey.</p>
    <h2>Artistry in Every Arrangement</h2>
    <P>Each bouquet is a carefully crafted composition,<br> blending color, texture, and meaning<br> like poetry on a page.</P>
    <h2>Flowers That Understand You</h2>
    <p>More than beauty, <br>our blooms speak the language of the heart—<br>because every sentiment deserves to be felt, <br>not just seen.</p>
